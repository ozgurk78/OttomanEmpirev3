-Like other Loot projects, anything can be built on it.

-In the Polygon network, NFTs can be viewed directly with programs such as Opensea or NFTrade, 
 but it is not possible to see the NFTs in this project right now, because a format other than NFT imaging standards is working, 
 a special viewing web page can be made for this project, it can be viewed as I mentioned above.
 
-This is an experimental project.
